This is a fork of RuneLite, the popular open source client for OldSchool RuneScape. It contains a work-in-progress storage tracker plugin. Details will be added as time goes on.

### Planned Features
- STASH Units
- Costume Room
- Tool Leprechaun
- Fossil Island?

I'm debating on tracking the seed storage, but that feature may be big enough for its own plugin.
